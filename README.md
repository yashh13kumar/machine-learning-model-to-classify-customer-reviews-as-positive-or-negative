Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset. It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The notebook also suggests exploring advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTMs for improved performance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data.
Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF vectorization.
Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV for optimization.
Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using accuracy and other metrics.
